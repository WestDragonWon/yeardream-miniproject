# MLOps & DataPipeline System

[한국어](./README_ko.md)

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust system that integrates **MLOps** and **DataPipeline**. By leveraging **AWS** and **Kubernetes (K8s)**, we aim to automate machine learning workflows and data processing pipelines to provide a production-level solution for scaling machine learning models and handling large-scale data.

## Key Features
- **MLOps Automation**: Automating machine learning model development, deployment, and monitoring processes using MLflow, FastAPI, and S3.
- **Data Pipeline**: Efficient data processing and ETL pipelines designed with Apache Airflow to manage and streamline data workflows.
- **High Availability (HA)**: Ensuring system reliability and uptime using Kubernetes orchestration and multi-region AWS architecture.
- **Security & Scalability**: Focus on secure handling of data and scalability of services across multiple cloud environments.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implementing continuous integration and deployment to increase productivity and reduce time-to-production.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized usage of resources under limited budget constraints, focusing on high availability and performance while keeping costs low.

## Project Goals
1. Build a fully automated **MLOps** system for deploying machine learning models in production.
2. Create a reliable and scalable **Data Pipeline** to handle large volumes of data.
3. Ensure security and data persistence throughout the workflow.
4. Apply Kubernetes and cloud-native tools to achieve high availability and fault tolerance.
5. Incorporate continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to streamline development processes.
